TimeLogger for Tempo
=====================
Timelogger acts like an alarm clock, reminding you to fill your time at a pre-defined interval.
The time you log can then be used to send to Tempo within Jira.

- Allows you to pick a start time (incase you forget to clock in first thing)
- Prompts you on a regular basis
- Tracks the time you take in logging mode and logs a generic ticket for logging time to a pre-defined ticket. (eg. admin)
- Snooze functionality
- Log time at any time - you don't have to wait for the timer.
- Clock out any time - stop the timer, but you will have to answer for the unlogged time.
- Breaks - for lunch or when you went home and forgot to clock out!
- See your progress - A progress bar shows how much time you have left to fill... for now.
- RavenDB: You can see your logs using the RavenDB web interface and even edit the data.
- Push To Tempo: At the end of the week, simply hit submit for each day you logged time for.

WARNING: ALWAYS CLOCK OUT AND CLOCK BACK IN BETWEEN DAYS.
